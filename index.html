<h1>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Daniel Tull</span>, a freelance Mac, iPhone <span class="highlight amp">&amp;</span> iPad Developer</h1>
<h2>If you need someone to make lovely <span class="highlight">Cocoa</span> applications, <span class="highlight">look no further</span>.</h2>
<p>This is my place on the web to share my thoughts, code and basically pimp myself out. 
Below are some links to the aforementioned ramblings and the source code I've developed in recent times, to both of these you may help yourself.
You may also want to check out my past work, which is also listed. As are some ways to get hold of me, should you not know already.
Please be kind and gentle around my site and enjoy your stay.</p>
